## System Overview

{{SYSTEM_OVERVIEW}}

<!-- 2-3 paragraphs describing:
- What the system does (from product.md)
- Key architectural style (monolith, microservices, modular monolith, etc.)
- Primary technology choices (from tech-stack.md)
- Scale and deployment context
-->

## Component Map

{{COMPONENT_MAP}}

<!-- ASCII or Markdown diagram showing all components and their connections.
     Format:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Frontend    │────▶│  API Gateway │────▶│  Auth       │
│  (React)     │     │  (Kong)      │     │  (FastAPI)  │
└─────────────┘     └──────┬───────┘     └─────────────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────┴───────┐
                    │  Core API    │────▶ PostgreSQL
                    │  (FastAPI)   │────▶ Redis
                    └──────────────┘
```

Each component should list:
- Name and technology
- Responsibility (one line)
- Key interfaces it exposes or consumes

## Technology Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| {{DECISION_1}} | {{CHOICE_1}} | {{RATIONALE_1}} |

<!-- List key technology choices that aren't obvious from tech-stack.md.
     Focus on WHY, not WHAT. Examples:
     | Message broker | Redis Streams | Already in stack for caching; volume doesn't justify Kafka |
     | Auth strategy | JWT + refresh tokens | Stateless verification, mobile-friendly |
     | ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 | Async support, mature migration tooling (Alembic) |
-->

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: {{ADR_TITLE}}

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** {{DATE}}
- **Context:** {{CONTEXT}}
- **Decision:** {{DECISION}}
- **Consequences:** {{CONSEQUENCES}}

<!-- One ADR per significant architectural decision made during decompose.
     Focus on decisions that:
     - Were debated (multiple viable options)
     - Constrain future choices
     - Came from architecture research recommendations

     Keep each ADR to 3-5 sentences per section. ADR format:
     - Context: What forces are at play?
     - Decision: What did we decide and why?
     - Consequences: What becomes easier? What becomes harder?

## Accepted Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Tier | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| {{PATTERN_1}} | {{TIER_1}} | {{RATIONALE_1}} |

<!-- Patterns accepted by the developer during architecture research.
     Tier values: Strongly Recommended, Recommended, Consider for Later.
     "Consider for later" patterns should reference their deferred triggers
     (e.g., "CQRS — trigger: dashboard queries > 500ms").
-->

---

## Deferred Pattern Triggers

These patterns were classified as "Consider for Later" during architecture research. They become measurable thresholds in the discovery-check hook.

| Pattern | Trigger Condition | Discovery Classification |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| {{PATTERN}} | {{TRIGGER}} | {{CLASSIFICATION}} |

<!-- Example:
| CQRS | Dashboard queries consistently > 500ms | NEW_TRACK |
| Circuit Breaker | External API failure rate > 5% over 15min | CROSS_CUTTING_CHANGE |
| Event Sourcing | Audit/compliance requirement emerges | ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE |
-->
