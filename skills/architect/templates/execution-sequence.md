# Execution Sequence

> Wave-based ordering derived from the dependency graph.
> Generated by: `python scripts/topological_sort.py`
> Validated by: `python scripts/validate_wave_completion.py`
>
> Tracks within the same wave are independent and can run in parallel.
> All tracks in a wave must complete before the next wave starts.

## Wave {{N}} — {{WAVE_NAME}}

| # | Track ID | Complexity | Description |
|---|----------|------------|-------------|
| {{SEQ}} | {{TRACK_ID}} | {{COMPLEXITY}} | {{SHORT_DESC}} |

### Wave {{N}} Completion Criteria
- [ ] All phases in all wave tracks marked complete
- [ ] All track tests passing (`metadata.json` test_command)
- [ ] No BLOCKING discoveries in `architect/discovery/pending/`
- [ ] All patches with `blocks_wave == {{N+1}}` are COMPLETE
- {{WAVE_SPECIFIC_CRITERIA}}

<!-- Example:

## Wave 1 — Foundation

| # | Track ID | Complexity | Description |
|---|----------|------------|-------------|
| 01 | 01_infra_scaffold | M | Docker Compose, CI/CD, project structure |
| 13 | 13_observability | S | OTel collector, Grafana, structured logging setup |

### Wave 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All phases in all wave tracks marked complete
- [ ] All track tests passing
- [ ] No BLOCKING discoveries in pending/
- [ ] Docker Compose starts all base services
- [ ] OTel collector receiving traces from test service
- [ ] Health check endpoints responding on base services

## Wave 2 — Core Services

| # | Track ID | Complexity | Description |
|---|----------|------------|-------------|
| 02 | 02_database_schema | M | PostgreSQL schema, migrations, seed data |
| 05 | 05_frontend_shell | M | React app scaffold, routing, auth integration |
| 06 | 06_redis_queue | S | Redis connection, queue abstraction, DLQ |

### Wave 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All phases in all wave tracks marked complete
- [ ] All track tests passing
- [ ] No BLOCKING discoveries in pending/
- [ ] Migrations apply cleanly on fresh database
- [ ] React app renders and routes work
- [ ] Redis responds to PING and queue enqueue/dequeue works

## Progress Summary

| Wave | Tracks | Total Complexity | Status |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| {{N}} | {{COUNT}} | {{WEIGHTED_SUM}} | {{STATUS}} |

<!-- Status values: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE
     Complexity weights: S=1, M=2, L=3, XL=4
     Total complexity = sum of weights for tracks in that wave

Example:
| Wave | Tracks | Total Complexity | Status |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | 3 (M+S) | COMPLETE |
| 2 | 3 | 5 (M+M+S) | IN_PROGRESS |
| 3 | 1 | 3 (L) | NOT_STARTED |
| 4 | 1 | 4 (XL) | NOT_STARTED |
| 5 | 6 | 14 (L+M+XL+M+L+M) | NOT_STARTED |

Overall: 5/29 complexity-weighted units complete (17%)
